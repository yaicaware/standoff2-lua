## Uploading neccessarry things to host
To get ready, you'll need to download source code, do it:

after that you'll need to extract folder to any place that you want on your desktop. 
now open that folder

now you'll need to upload scripts to any host that you want, I prefer pastebin.com, it's free and easy to use.
Now you'll need to be signed in, in order to edit your pastes

(choose sign in or sign up)

after you signed in, choose "create new paste" and here we will be writing our codes.

just open every file and copy paste all code to paste window

it should look like this (that's set menu).
now name it with friendly name and click "Create new paste".
after that you'll need to clone "raw" link in order to use it in scripts.
it should look like this:

now redo everything same in all files.

after you uploaded everything, it should look like this:

okay. now we need to edit link in wave cfg builder in order it to function normally.
open it and look for "site/"

now replace it with our "base skins" raw link.

now save changes.

uploading now done.
## Making changes to boot main script.
after upload finished, you'll need to replace in your script all "site/" links to yours.
open it in any friendly text editor, and replace following links:

and replace it with your "raw" links.
for example, there's /updates link, we'll replace it with "updates checker" raw link
